    <p>Study after study has shown that women inherently excel in science, technology, and math related fields.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One groundbreaking meta-analysis that compiled data from 100 different studies of math performance, synthesizing data collected on more than 3 million participants between 1967 and 1987, found no differences between boys and girls in math performance. In fact, girls were slightly better at computation in elementary and middle school. Boys and girls understood math concepts equally well and any gender differences actually narrowed over the years, belying the notion of a fixed or biological differentiating factor.</li>
      <li>Also in 2005, Elizabeth Spelke, PhD, a psychologist at Harvard University, and colleagues reviewed 111 studies and concluded that gender differences in math and science ability have a genetic basis in cognitive systems that emerge in early childhood. Nevertheless, the studies suggested that men and women on the whole possess an equal aptitude for math and science. In fact, boy and girl infants were found to perform equally well as young as 6 months on tasks that underlie mathematics abilities.</li>
      <li>A 2008 analysis by Hyde and colleagues reported that in children from grades two to 11, there was no gender difference for math skills. </li>
      <li>There is no difference in math aptitude before age 7.  Starting in adolescence, some differences appear (boys score approximately 30-35 points higher than girls on the math portion of the SAT).  But, scores on different subcategories of math vary tremendously (often with girls outperforming boys consistently).
